## Overview

This is intended to be a general purpose, garbage collecting storage
allocator.  The algorithms used are described in:

   Environment", Software Practice & Experience, September 1988, pp. 807-820.

Unlike the collector described in the second reference, this collector
operates either with the mutator stopped during the entire collection
(default) or incrementally during allocations.  (The latter is supported
on fewer machines.)  On the most common platforms, it can be built
with or without thread support.  On some platforms, it can take advantage
of a multiprocessor to speed up garbage collection.

Many of the ideas underlying the collector have previously been explored
by others.  Notably, some of the run-time systems developed at Xerox PARC
in the early 1980s conservatively scanned thread stacks to locate possible
pointers (cf. Paul Rovner, "On Adding Garbage Collection and Runtime Types
to a Strongly-Typed Statically Checked, Concurrent Language" Xerox PARC
CSL 84-7).  Doug McIlroy wrote a simpler fully conservative collector that
was part of version 8 UNIX (tm), but appears to not have received
widespread use.

Rudimentary tools for use of the collector as a [leak detector](docs/leak.md)
are included, as is a fairly sophisticated string package "cord" that
makes use of the collector.  (See [cords.md](docs/cords.md) and
H.-J. Boehm, R. Atkinson, and M. Plass, "Ropes: An Alternative to Strings",
Software Practice and Experience 25, 12 (December 1995), pp. 1315-1330.
This is very similar to the "rope" package in Xerox Cedar, or the "rope"
package in the SGI STL or the g++ distribution.)

Further collector documentation can be found in the
[overview](docs/overview.md).

Some of the known uses of the collector are listed on the GitHub
[Known-clients](https://github.com/bdwgc/bdwgc/wiki/Known-clients) page.


## General Description

This is a garbage collecting storage allocator that is intended to be
used as a plug-in replacement for C's malloc.

Since the collector does not require pointers to be tagged, it does not
attempt to ensure that all inaccessible storage is reclaimed.  However,
in our experience, it is typically more successful at reclaiming unused
memory than most C programs using explicit deallocation.  Unlike manually
introduced leaks, the amount of unreclaimed memory typically stays
bounded.

In the following, an "object" is defined to be a region of memory allocated
by the routines described below.

Any objects not intended to be collected must be pointed to either
from other such accessible objects, or from the registers,
stack, data, or statically allocated bss segments.  Pointers from
the stack or registers may point to anywhere inside an object.
The same is true for heap pointers if the collector is compiled with
`ALL_INTERIOR_POINTERS` defined, or `GC_all_interior_pointers` is otherwise
set, as is now the default.

Compiling without `ALL_INTERIOR_POINTERS` may reduce accidental retention
of garbage objects, by requiring pointers from the heap to the beginning
of an object.  But this no longer appears to be a significant
issue for most programs occupying a small fraction of the possible
address space.

There are a number of routines which modify the pointer recognition
algorithm.  `GC_register_displacement` allows certain interior pointers
to be recognized even if `ALL_INTERIOR_POINTERS` is not defined.
`GC_malloc_ignore_off_page` allows some pointers into the middle of
large objects to be disregarded, greatly reducing the probability of
accidental retention of large objects.  For most purposes it seems
best to compile with `ALL_INTERIOR_POINTERS` and to use
`GC_malloc_ignore_off_page` if you get collector warnings from
allocations of very large objects.  See [here](docs/debugging.md) for details.

*Warning*: pointers inside memory allocated by the standard (system) `malloc`
are not seen by the garbage collector.  Thus objects pointed to only from such
a region may be prematurely deallocated.  It is thus suggested that the
standard `malloc` be used only for memory regions, such as I/O buffers, that
are guaranteed not to contain pointers to garbage collectible memory.
Pointers in C language automatic, static, or register variables,
are correctly recognized.  (Note that `GC_malloc_uncollectable` has
semantics similar to standard malloc, but allocates objects that are
traced by the collector.)

*Warning*: the collector does not always know how to find pointers in data
areas that are associated with dynamic libraries.  This is easy to remedy
if you know how to find those data areas on your operating system (see
`GC_add_roots`).  Code for doing this under SunOS, Irix 5.x and 6.x, HP/UX,
Alpha OSF/1 (Tru64 UNIX), Linux, and Win32 is included and used by default.
(See [README.win32](docs/platforms/README.win32) and
[README.win64](docs/platforms/README.win64) for Windows details.)  On other
systems, pointers from dynamic library data areas may not be considered by the
collector.  If you are writing a program that depends on the collector
scanning dynamic library data areas, it may be a good idea to include at least
one call to `GC_is_visible` to ensure that those areas are visible to the
collector.

Note that the garbage collector does not need to be informed of shared
read-only data.  However, if the shared library mechanism can introduce
discontiguous data areas that may contain pointers then the collector does
need to be informed.

Signal processing for most signals may be deferred during collection,
and during uninterruptible parts of the allocation process.
Like standard ANSI C mallocs, by default it is unsafe to invoke
malloc (and other GC routines) from a signal handler while another
malloc call may be in progress.

The allocator/collector can also be configured for thread-safe operation.
(Full signal safety can also be achieved, but only at the cost of two system
calls per malloc, which is usually unacceptable.)

*Warning*: the collector does not guarantee to scan thread-local storage
(e.g. of the kind accessed with `pthread_getspecific`).  The collector
does scan thread stacks, though, so generally the best solution is to
ensure that any pointers stored in thread-local storage are also
stored on the thread's stack for the duration of their lifetime.
(This is arguably a longstanding bug, but it has not been fixed yet.)


## Building and Installing

There are multiple ways to build the collector:

  * CMake (it is the recommended way)
  * GNU autoconf/automake
  * Zig (experimental)
  * MS nmake (directly)
  * Makefile.direct
  * Manual C compilation

### CMake

The simplest way to build `gc` library (as well as `cord` library) and run
the tests using CMake:

```sh
mkdir out
cd out
cmake -Dbuild_tests=ON ..
cmake --build .
ctest
```

This is the most cross-platform way of building the library.
See [cmake.md](docs/cmake.md) for details.

### GNU Autoconf/Automake

Please note that the collector source repository does not contain `configure`
and similar auto-generated files, thus the full procedure of `autoconf`-based
build of the collector from the source repository could look like:

```sh
./autogen.sh
./configure
make check
```

The GNU style build process understands the usual targets and options.
`make install` installs `gc` and `cord` libraries.  Try `./configure --help`
to see all the configuration options.  It is currently not possible to
exercise all combinations of build options this way.

See [autoconf.md](docs/autoconf.md) for details.

### Zig

Building and testing the collector using zig is straight forward in its
simplest form:

```sh
zig build test
```

It is possible to configure the build through the use of variables, e.g.
`zig build -Denable_redirect_malloc -Denable_threads=false`.  Zig offers
excellent cross-compilation functionality, it is configurable like this:

```sh
zig build -Dtarget=riscv64-linux-musl
```

The appropriate Zig binary package file could be downloaded from the official
[Zig releases](https://ziglang.org/download/) page.

### MS nmake

On Windows, assuming the Microsoft build tools are installed and suitably
configured, it is possible to build the library and run the tests using
`nmake` directly, e.g. by by typing `nmake -f NT_MAKEFILE check`.  However,
the recommended way is to use cmake as described above.

See [README.win32](docs/platforms/README.win32) for details.

### Makefile.direct

For the old-style (classic) makefile-based build process, typing
`make -f Makefile.direct check` will automatically build `gc`, `cord`
libraries, then run a number of tests such as `gctest`.  The test is
a somewhat superficial test of collector functionality.  Failure is indicated
by a core dump or a message to the effect that the collector is broken.
`gctest` may take a dozen of seconds to run on reasonable 2023 vintage 64-bit
desktops.  It may use up to about 30 MB of memory.

`Makefile.direct` file generates a `libgc.a` file which you should link
against.

### Manual C Compilation

Finally, on most targets, the collector could be built and tested directly
with a single compiler invocation, like this (the sample lacks multi-threading
support):

```sh
cc -I include -o gctest tests/gctest.c extra/gc.c && ./gctest
```

E.g., this could be convenient for a debugging purpose.

### Configurable Macros

The library can be configured more precisely during the build by defining
the macros listed in [macros.md](docs/macros.md) file.

The library is built with threads support enabled (i.e. for thread-safe
operation) by default, unless explicitly disabled by:

  * `-Denable_threads=false` option passed to `cmake` or `zig build`
  * `--disable-threads` option passed to `./configure`

The collector operates silently in the default configuration.
In the event of issues, this can usually be changed by defining the
`GC_PRINT_STATS` or `GC_PRINT_VERBOSE_STATS` environment variables.  This
will result in a few lines of descriptive output for each collection.
(The given statistics exhibit a few peculiarities.
Things do not appear to add up for a variety of reasons, most notably
fragmentation losses.  These are probably much more significant for the
contrived program `gctest` than for your application.)

### Atomic_ops

Use (cloning) of `libatomic_ops` is now optional provided the compiler
supports atomic intrinsics.  Most modern compilers do.  The notable exception
is the MS compiler (as of Visual Studio 2022).

If needed, most OS distributes have `libatomic_ops` package; alternatively,
you can download or clone it from
[libatomic_ops](https://github.com/bdwgc/libatomic_ops) repository on GitHub.


## Portability

The collector currently is designed to run essentially unmodified on
machines that use a flat 32-bit or 64-bit address space.
That includes the vast majority of Workstations and x86 (i386 or later) PCs.

In a few cases (e.g., OS/2, Win32) a separate makefile is supplied; these have
a separate host-specific docs/platforms/README.* file.

Dynamic libraries are completely supported only under SunOS/Solaris,
(and even that support is not functional on the last Sun 3 release),
Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Irix, HP/UX, Win32 (not win32s) and Tru64 UNIX
on DEC AXP machines plus perhaps a few others listed near the top
of dyn_load.c.  On other machines we recommend that you do one of
the following:

  1. Add dynamic library support (and send us the code).

  2. Use static versions of the libraries.

  3. Arrange for dynamic libraries to use the standard malloc. This is still
     dangerous if the library stores a pointer to a garbage-collected object.
     But nearly all standard interfaces prohibit this, because they deal
     correctly with pointers to stack allocated objects.  (`strtok` is an
     exception.  Do not use it.)

In all cases we assume that pointer alignment is consistent with that
enforced by the standard C compilers.  If you use a nonstandard compiler
you may have to adjust the alignment parameters defined in
`include/private/gc_priv.h` file.  Note that this may also be an issue with
packed records/structs, if those enforce less alignment for pointers.

A port to a machine that is not byte addressed, or does not use 32 bit
or 64 bit addresses will require a major effort.  A port to plain MSDOS
or win16 is hard.

For machines not already mentioned, or for nonstandard compilers,
some porting suggestions are provided [here](docs/porting.md).


## The C Interface to the Allocator

The following routines are intended to be directly called by the user.
Note that usually only `GC_malloc` is necessary.  `GC_clear_roots` and
`GC_add_roots` calls may be required if the collector has to trace
from nonstandard places (e.g. from dynamic library data areas on a
machine on which the collector does not already understand them.)  On
some machines, it may be desirable to set `GC_stackbottom` to a good
approximation of the stack base (bottom).

Client code may include `gc.h` file, which defines all of the following, plus
many others.

  1. `GC_malloc(bytes)` - Allocate an object of a given size.
     Unlike `malloc`, the object is cleared before being returned to the user.
     `GC_malloc` will invoke the garbage collector when it determines this to
     be appropriate.  `GC_malloc` may return 0 if it is unable to acquire
     sufficient space from the operating system.  This is the most probable
     consequence of running out of space.  Other possible consequences are
     that a function call will fail due to lack of stack space, or that the
     collector will fail in other ways because it cannot maintain its internal
     data structures, or that a crucial system process will fail and take down
     the machine.  Most of these possibilities are independent of the `malloc`
     implementation.

  2. `GC_malloc_atomic(bytes)` - Allocate an object of a given size that
     is guaranteed not to contain any pointers.  The returned object is not
     guaranteed to be cleared.  (Can always be replaced by `GC_malloc`, but
     results in faster collection times.  The collector will probably run
     faster if large character arrays, etc. are allocated with
     `GC_malloc_atomic` than if they are statically allocated.)

  3. `GC_realloc(object, new_bytes)` - Change the size of object to be of
     a given size.  Returns a pointer to the new object, which may, or may
     not, be the same as the pointer to the old object.  The new object is
     taken to be atomic if and only if the old one was.  If the new object
     is composite and larger than the original object then the newly added
     bytes are cleared. This is very likely to allocate a new object.

  4. `GC_free(object)` - Explicitly deallocate an object returned by
     `GC_malloc` or `GC_malloc_atomic`, or friends.  Not necessary, but can
     be used to minimize collections if performance is critical.  Probably
     a performance loss could occur for very small objects (not greater than
     8 bytes).

  5. `GC_expand_hp(bytes)` - Explicitly increase the heap size.  (This is
     normally done automatically if a garbage collection failed to reclaim
     enough memory.  Explicit calls to `GC_expand_hp` may prevent
     unnecessarily frequent collections at program startup.)

  6. `GC_malloc_ignore_off_page(bytes)` - Identical to `GC_malloc`, but the
     client promises to keep a pointer to the somewhere within the first GC
     heap block (512 .. 4096 bytes or even more, depending on the
     configuration) of the object while it is live.  (This pointer should
     normally be declared `volatile` to prevent interference from compiler
     optimizations.)  This is the recommended way to allocate anything that
     is likely to be larger than 100 KB or so.  (`GC_malloc` may result in
     a failure to reclaim such objects.)

  7. `GC_set_warn_proc(proc)` - Can be used to redirect warnings from the
     collector.  Such warnings should be rare, and should not be ignored
     during code development.

  8. `GC_enable_incremental()` - Enables generational and incremental
     collection.  Useful for large heaps on machines that provide access to
     page dirty information.  Some dirty bit implementations may interfere
     with debugging (by catching address faults) and place restrictions on
     heap arguments to system calls (since write faults inside a system call
     may not be handled well).

  9. `GC_register_finalizer(object, proc, data, 0, 0)` and friends - Allow
     for registration of finalization code.  User-supplied finalization code
     (`(*proc)(object, data)`) is invoked after object becomes unreachable.
     For more sophisticated uses, and for finalization ordering issues, see
     `gc.h` file.

The global variable `GC_free_space_divisor` may be adjusted up from it
default value of 3 to use less space and more collection time, or down for
the opposite effect.  Setting it to 1 will almost disable collections
and cause all allocations to simply grow the heap.

The variable `GC_non_gc_bytes`, which is normally 0, may be changed to reflect
the amount of memory allocated by the above routines that should not be
considered as a candidate for collection.  Careless use may, of course, result
in excessive memory consumption.

Some additional tuning is possible through the parameters defined
near the top of `include/private/gc_priv.h` file.

If only `GC_malloc` is intended to be used, it might be appropriate to define
like:

```c
#define malloc(n) GC_malloc(n)
#define calloc(m, n) GC_malloc((m) * (n))
```

For small pieces of *very* allocation-intensive code, `gc_inline.h` file
includes some allocation macros that may be used in place of `GC_malloc` and
friends.

All externally visible names in the garbage collector start with `GC_`.
To avoid name conflicts, client code should avoid this prefix, except when
accessing garbage collector routines.

There are provisions for allocation with explicit type information.
This is rarely necessary.  Details can be found in `gc_typed.h` file.


## The C++ Interface to the Allocator

The Ellis-Hull C++ interface to the collector is included in the collector
distribution.  If you intend to use this, type
`./configure --enable-cplusplus && make` (or
`cmake -Denable_cplusplus=ON . && cmake --build .`, or
`make -f Makefile.direct c++` depending on the build system you use).
This creates `libgccpp.a` and `libgctba.a` files, or their shared library
equivalents (`libgccpp.so` and `libgctba.so` files).  You should link with
either the first (`gccpp`) or the second one (`gctba`), but not both.
See `gc_cpp.h` file and [here](docs/gcinterface.md) for the definition of the
interface.  This interface tries to approximate the Ellis-Detlefs C++ garbage
collection proposal without compiler changes.

Very often it will also be necessary to use `gc_allocator.h` file and the
allocator declared there to construct STL data structures.  Otherwise
subobjects of STL data structures will be allocated using a system
allocator, and objects they refer to may be prematurely collected.


## Use as Leak Detector

The collector may be used to track down leaks in C programs that are
intended to run with `malloc`/`free` (e.g. code with extreme real-time or
portability constraints).  To do so define `FIND_LEAK` macro (e.g. by passing
it in `CFLAGS_EXTRA` variable of `Makefile.direct` file).  This will cause
the collector to print a human-readable object description whenever
an inaccessible object is found that has not been explicitly freed.
Such objects will also be automatically reclaimed.

If all objects are allocated with `GC_DEBUG_MALLOC` (see the next section)
then, by default, the human-readable object description will at least contain
the source file and the line number at which the leaked object was allocated.
This may sometimes be sufficient.  (On a few machines, it will also report
a cryptic stack trace.  If this is not symbolic, it can sometimes be called
into a symbolic stack trace by invoking program "foo" with
`tools/callprocs.sh foo`.  It is a short shell script that invokes adb to
expand program counter values to symbolic addresses.  It was largely supplied
by Scott Schwartz.)

Note that the debugging facilities described in the next section can
sometimes be slightly *less* effective in the leak finding mode, because
`GC_debug_free` actually results in reuse of the object.  (Otherwise the
object is simply marked invalid.)  Also, note that most GC tests are not
designed to run meaningfully in `FIND_LEAK` mode.


## Debugging Facilities

The routines `GC_debug_malloc`, `GC_debug_malloc_atomic`, `GC_debug_realloc`,
and `GC_debug_free` provide an alternate interface to the collector, which
provides some help with memory overwrite errors, and the like.
Objects allocated in this way are annotated with additional
information.  Some of this information is checked during garbage
collections, and detected inconsistencies are reported to `stderr`.

Simple cases of writing past the end of an allocated object should
be caught if the object is explicitly deallocated, or if the
collector is invoked while the object is live.  The first deallocation
of an object will clear the debugging info associated with an
object, so accidentally repeated calls to `GC_debug_free` will report the
deallocation of an object without debugging information.  Out of
memory errors will be reported to `stderr`, in addition to returning `NULL`.

`GC_debug_malloc` checking during garbage collection is enabled
with the first call to this function.  This will result in some
slowdown during collections.  If frequent heap checks are desired,
this can be achieved by explicitly invoking `GC_gcollect`, e.g. from
the debugger.

`GC_debug_malloc` allocated objects should not be passed to `GC_realloc`
or `GC_free`, and conversely.  It is however acceptable to allocate only
some objects with `GC_debug_malloc`, and to use `GC_malloc` for other objects,
provided the two pools are kept distinct.  In this case, there is a very
low probability that `GC_malloc` allocated objects may be misidentified as
having been overwritten.  This should happen with probability at most
one in 2**32.  This probability is zero if `GC_debug_malloc` is never called.

`GC_debug_malloc`, `GC_debug_malloc_atomic`, and `GC_debug_realloc` take two
additional trailing arguments, a string and an integer.  These are not
interpreted by the allocator.  They are stored in the object (the string is
not copied).  If an error involving the object is detected, they are printed.

The macros `GC_MALLOC`, `GC_MALLOC_ATOMIC`, `GC_REALLOC`, `GC_FREE`,
`GC_REGISTER_FINALIZER` and friends are also provided.  These require the same
arguments as the corresponding (nondebugging) routines.  If `gc.h` file is
included with `GC_DEBUG` defined, they call the debugging versions of these
functions, passing the current file name and line number as the two
extra arguments, where appropriate.  If `gc.h` file is included without
`GC_DEBUG` macro defined then all these macros will instead be defined to
their nondebugging equivalents.  (`GC_REGISTER_FINALIZER` is necessary, since
pointers to objects with debugging information are really pointers to
a displacement of 16 bytes from the object beginning, and some translation is
necessary when finalization routines are invoked.  For details, about what is
stored in the header, see the definition of the type `oh` in `dbg_mlc.h`
file.)


## Incremental/Generational Collection

The collector normally interrupts client code for the duration of
a garbage collection mark phase.  This may be unacceptable if interactive
response is needed for programs with large heaps.  The collector
can also run in a "generational" mode, in which it usually attempts to
collect only objects allocated since the last garbage collection.
Furthermore, in this mode, garbage collections run mostly incrementally,
with a small amount of work performed in response to each of a large number of
`GC_malloc` requests.

This mode is enabled by a call to `GC_enable_incremental`.

Incremental and generational collection is effective in reducing
pause times only if the collector has some way to tell which objects
or pages have been recently modified.  The collector uses two sources
of information:

  1. Information provided by the VM system.  This may be provided in one of
     several forms.  Under Solaris 2.x (and potentially under other similar
     systems) information on dirty pages can be read from the `/proc` file
     system.  Under other systems (e.g. SunOS 4.x) it is possible to
     write-protect the heap, and catch the resulting faults.  On these systems
     we require that system calls writing to the heap (other than `read`) be
     handled specially by client code.  See `os_dep.c` for details.

  2. Information supplied by the programmer.  The object is considered dirty
     after a call to `GC_end_stubborn_change` provided the library has been
     compiled suitably.  It is typically not worth using for short-lived
     objects.  Note that bugs caused by a missing `GC_end_stubborn_change` or
     `GC_reachable_here` call are likely to be observed very infrequently and
     hard to trace.


## Bugs

Any memory that does not have a recognizable pointer to it will be reclaimed.
Exclusive-or'ing forward and backward links in a list does not cut it.

Some C optimizers may lose the last undisguised pointer to a memory
object as a consequence of clever optimizations.  This has almost
never been observed in practice.

This is not a real-time collector.  In the standard configuration,
percentage of time required for collection should be constant across
heap sizes.  But collection pauses will increase for larger heaps.
They will decrease with the number of processors if parallel marking
is enabled.

(On 2007 vintage machines, GC times may be on the order of 5 ms
per MB of accessible memory that needs to be scanned and processed.
Your mileage may vary.)  The incremental/generational collection facility
may help in some cases.
